## Description

i downloaded all the .img/ .ico files i need from the "Dropbox" website. i used the position tool to place all the objects in order insted of the flex tool. i separated all the objects within different divs who divided the page to 2 horizontal parts; "main" and "nev".

in the "main" div i placed the pictur and the headlines.

in the "nev" div i placed the links.
